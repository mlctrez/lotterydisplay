Broadcasts time and temp via UDP packets. Packets are received by a ESP8266 MCU and displayed on a surplus lottery
display.

The display came from [Gateway Electronics](https://www.gatewayelectronics.com/)
which [closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/iyh9e7/gateway_electronics_closing_end_of_october/) in 2020.
Hopefully they will return.

Temperature is sourced from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/).
